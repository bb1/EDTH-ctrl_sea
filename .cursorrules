# Cursor Agent Instructions

## Runtime and Package Management

**ALWAYS use Bun** for:
- Runtime execution (`bun run`, `bun <script>`)
- Package installation (`bun install`, `bun add`, `bun remove`)
- Script execution (`bun run <script>`)
- Development server (`bun --bun dev` or `bun dev`)

**NEVER use:**
- `npm` or `yarn` commands
- `node` directly (use `bun` instead)
- Other package managers

## Native Bun Functionality

**Prefer native Bun features:**
- Use Bun's built-in web server (`Bun.serve()`) instead of Express, Fastify, or other frameworks when possible
- Use Bun's native file operations (`Bun.file()`, `Bun.write()`) instead of `fs` when appropriate
- Leverage Bun's native SQLite support (`Bun.SQLite`) when needed
- Use Bun's native test runner (`bun test`) instead of Jest/Vitest when possible

## Project Structure

This project follows a modular architecture:

### Top-Level Folders

- **`client/`** - Frontend application code (web client, UI components, user-facing interfaces)
  - Contains the source code for the client-side application
  - Typically includes React, Vue, or similar framework code

- **`aggregators/`** - Data aggregation services and logic
  - Services that collect, process, and combine data from multiple sources
  - Business logic for data transformation and aggregation

- **`data_sources/`** - Data source integrations and adapters
  - **`ais/`** - AIS (Automatic Identification System) data source integration
    - Maritime vessel tracking data
  - **`infrastructure/`** - Infrastructure-related data sources
    - Infrastructure monitoring, sensor data, or system metrics

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow modern JavaScript/TypeScript best practices
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Prefer async/await over promises when possible

## When Creating New Files

- Use Bun-compatible syntax and APIs
- Check if Bun has native support before adding external dependencies
- Prefer Bun's built-in features over third-party packages when equivalent functionality exists
