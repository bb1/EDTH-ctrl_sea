# Infrastructure Intersection Analysis

## Trajectory Overview

The ship trajectory analyzed consists of three coordinates representing a slow travel section:

1. **Point 1**: 54.3374597°N, 12.0771658°E
2. **Point 2**: 54.3310199°N, 11.9667175°E  
3. **Point 3**: 54.3353132°N, 11.8415427°E

This trajectory forms two segments in the Baltic Sea region.

## Intersection Results

### ✅ Direct Intersections Found: 2

The trajectory **directly crosses** two submarine internet cables:

1. **Elektra-GlobalConnect 1 (GC1)**
   - Intersects with: Trajectory Segment 2 (between Point 2 and Point 3)
   - Cable ID: `elektra-globalconnect-1-gc1`

2. **Germany-Denmark 3**
   - Intersects with: Trajectory Segment 1 (between Point 1 and Point 2)
   - Cable ID: `germany-denmark-3`

### ⚠️ Nearby Infrastructure

One additional cable was detected within close proximity (~5.5 km):

- **GlobalConnect-KPN**
   - Minimum distance: ~3.22 km
